        		<h1>Hello, I'm Suraj Patil.</h1>
	<p> I am a PhD research scholar at Department of Technology, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, India. I am passionate about research in the 
	fields of Biometrics, Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Financial Analysis. I am actively pursuing developmental projects with concrete 
	research components which can be made into production in an end to end fashion using deep learning models, Hybrid Mobile App frameworks like Flutter and 
				Serverless architectures.

		<b>Jul 2020 - Present</b> 	 | 	 <a href="https://painting-score.herokuapp.com/">Drawing League App</a>		| 	 DL Startup<br>
        Problem Statement required development of image scoring ML models, testing and deploying into production. 5K+ images in database were used
for training the deep learning model.
        Mobile app is in deployment phase, soon to be live. Carried out all the phases in SDLC for full stack development.<br>
        <b>Tools:</b> Cloud Firestore, Heroku, Git, Flutter, Dart, Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS<br><br>
					
			<b>Nov 2019 - Jun 2020</b> 	 |  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stocks.stockassis">Stockassis App</a> 	 |	Stockassis<br>
	Stockassis was designed to be the world's #1 estimator with self evaluation, 
	that is stock centric and also provides self evaluatory measure for all the popular BSE30 stocks.
	Weighted average of regression methods was used for prediction based on different indicators of stock market.
         App was published on Google Play Store and was monetized using ads. Carried out all the phases in SDLC for full stack development. 
	Dedicated Dashboard for the app was made using

		<b>Jul 2014 - Jun 2015</b>	|	Master's Student, SPPU	<br> 
        <b>Master's Thesis:</b> Robust adaptive beam-forming for general-rank signal model with positive semi-definite (PSD) constraint for optimal solution<br>
	We propose a two step closed form solution of the formulated robust adaptive beamforming problem, 
	wherein a new single variable minimization problem is constructed. Result of this minimization is used to solve the robust adaptive beamforming problem. 
Using Lagrangeâ€™s Multiplier Method, a closed form solution for the robust adaptive beam-forming problem was achieved. 
		Simulation results verify the improvement in the performance by the proposed method over the current robust adaptive beamforming methods for general-rank signal model.<br>
