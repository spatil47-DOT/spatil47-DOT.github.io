		Oct 2017 - Present  |  PhD Research Scholar  |   <a href="http://unipune.ac.in/">Savitribai Phule Pune University</a>	<br> 
				<b>Thesis:</b> Towards Building Fingerprint Framework For Enhanced and Secured Matching<br> 
				Proposed an iterative finite time Hill-Climbing method based fingerprint Attack. Worked on U-net based Deep Learning Segmentation methods for fingerprint attack.
         Current work is focussed on the phase based AM-FM fingerprint model to increase feature representation.<br> 
         <b>Tools:</b> Python, MatLab, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
					
					
		Jul 2014 - Jun 2015  |  Robust Adaptive Beam-forming for Optimal Solution  |   <a href="\href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7151003/">Master's Thesis</a>	<br> 
         By introducing an auxiliary optimization variable and using Lagrangeâ€™s Multiplier Method, a closed form solution for the robust adaptive beam-forming problem was achieved.  
           Simulation results verify the improvement in the performance by the proposed method over the current methods.<br> 
         <b>Tools:</b> MatLab, Python, SciLab.
