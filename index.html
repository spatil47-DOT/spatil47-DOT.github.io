        		<h1>Hello, I'm Suraj Patil.</h1>
			<p> I am a PhD research scholar at Department of Technology, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, India. I am passionate about research in the 
				fields of Biometrics, Signal Processing and Computer Vision. I am actively pursuing developmental projects with concrete 
				reserach components which can be made into production in an end to end fashion using Hybrid Mobile App technologies like Flutter and 
				serverless architectures.

		Jul 2014 - Jun 2015  |    Master's Student, SPPU	<br> 
        <b>Master's Thesis:</b> Robust adaptive beam-forming for general-rank signal model with positive semi-definite (PSD) constraint for optimal solution<br>
	We propose a two step closed form solution of the formulated robust adaptive beamforming problem, 
	wherein a new single variable minimization problem is constructed. Result of this minimization is used to solve the robust adaptive beamforming problem. 
Using Lagrangeâ€™s Multiplier Method, a closed form solution for the robust adaptive beam-forming problem was achieved. 
		Simulation results verify the improvement in the performance by the proposed method over the current robust adaptive beamforming methods for general-rank signal model.<br>
